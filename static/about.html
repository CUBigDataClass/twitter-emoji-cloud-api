            <h2>Big Data Architecture</h2>
            <p class="text">
                For our Big Data Architecture class, we were tasked with creating a project to explore the current technologies used to manipulate big data. The main focus of the class was to provide us with the knowledge to choose and implement the right technologies for our project.

            <h2>The Data Set</h2>
            <p class="text">
                We started off by brainstroming as many ideas as we could think of and discussing how viable they were. We quickly realized that many of our initial ideas were going to involve scraping hard to get data so we shifted gears and started look at easily accesible data bases. We looked at the RTD, Twitter, Boulder Municipal, NOAA, Facebook, and Wikipedia data sets. After browsing through and more brainstorm sessions we decided to focus our problem around twitter data. It was accesible, had intersting data and easy to use API's.</p>
